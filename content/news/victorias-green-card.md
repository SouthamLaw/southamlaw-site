Victoria and her family have worked with Keith Southam in the past for immigration needs. This time, Victoria asked Keith to help after immigration denied her application for a green card. The denial reason was ostensibly due only to a missed fingerprint appointment. However, just a few weeks before the denial, immigration itself told Victoria she needn't go to the fingerprint appointment. Clearly, someone at immigration made a mistake. Keith helped Victoria file a motion to reconsider and also informally contacted the local immigration office. The strategy worked, and the local immigration office agreed to reconsider their decision, ultimately approving the application. Victoria is now - finally - a permanent resident of the United States!
